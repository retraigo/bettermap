# BetterMap

An extension of the Map class with more Array-like features.

## NOTE
Maps are not ordered data structures. JavaScript Maps store elements in the order of insertion. 
Any sorting / indexing method implemented involves converting the Map into an Array or Iterator
to do necessary operations.
